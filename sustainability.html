      <h1>Sustainability</h1>
      <p>
        Sustainability is a fuzzy word. At SILFEN it means putting action behind
        the words, considering all stakeholders and always aiming a little bit
        higher when creating another collection. As a young, global fashion
        brand, it is our duty to take care of the planet, not only for own sake,
        but for all future generations to come.
      </p>
      <p>
        Since day one, we have launched various initiatives to keep our carbon
        footprint to an absolute minimum as well as making conscious decisions
        concerning the social impact on the communities in the countries, in
        which we operate.
      </p>
      <p>
        As of 2020 we presented the brand under a new name,‚Äù SILFEN‚Äù. We believe
        that this small change further represents a new and greener future for
        SILFEN. We always strive to deliver high quality products in better
        materials. Within the next couple of collections, we will start
        implementing more conscious initiatives within the company, and we hope
        that this inspire you ‚Äì our customers and consumers, as we are all in
        this together!
      </p>
      <p>
        As a company with great manufacturing activities, we know that we have a
        responsibility. Our focus is to make as green a production as possible,
        and we will continue to launch new initiatives to lower our carbon
        footprint even further.
      </p>
      <p>Read our principles below.</p>

      <h2>Water</h2>
      <p>
        The fashion industry is one of the most polluting industries worldwide,
        and one of the biggest issues is the use and contamination of drinking
        water. We try to minimize the water consumption in our production in an
        effort to decrease its negative impact on the environment and to ensure
        local access to clean water.
      </p>
      <p>
        All cotton used for production of SILFEN bags is either made from
        eco-friendly or organic cotton. This means that there is much less
        consumption of water throughout production and treatment of our cotton,
        than conventional cotton products.
      </p>
      <p>
        In 2020 we will introduce a new collection of bags made from a new
        material; rPET or Recycled Polyethylene Terephthalate. This recycled
        material is primarily made from plastic waste collected from the oceans,
        or from recycled plastic bottles gathered from all over the world.
      </p>

      <h2>Shipping</h2>
      <p>
        We are aware of the major impact that the shipping industry have on our
        planet. Because of this, we strive to choose environmental-friendly
        shipping options when applicable. We are in close contact with other
        brands in our aim to minimize shipping as much as possible ‚Äì by joining
        forces.
      </p>
      <p>
        We strive to ship as much as possible in bulk ‚Äì mostly by sea or train.
        These are the most environmentally friendly modes of shipping, reducing
        polluting emissions.
      </p>

      <h2>Working Conditions</h2>
      <p>
        At Team Silfen, we believe that we have many, wide-spanning obligations.
        It is not only the environment, we must care for, but also the people
        who build our products from scratch. We believe that it is our job to
        amplify a healthy and socially responsible conduct within our
        organization, including all our suppliers. We ensure the ethical
        development of future generations by guaranteeing that our suppliers do
        not support or make use of child labor. We encourage our factories to
        ensure that all families have the possibility to put their children in
        school.
      </p>
      <p>
        Team Silfen provides insurance to all our hard-working employees as well
        as their family. Our factories also grant pensions to all employees,
        providing them with financial stability after retirement.
      </p>
      <p>
        We support the different religions of employees and protect their right
        to engage with rituals, prayers etc. at any time. We condemn
        discrimination, and make sure that the employees are protected from
        prejudice and injustice at the workplace.
      </p>
      <p>
        We visit our manufacturers regularly to ensure that they follow the
        issued principles regarding working conditions, quality, pollution etc.
        This allows us to promise our customers that a SILFEN bag is always
        crafted in a responsible manner.
      </p>
      <p>All our manufacturers are SA8000 certified.</p>

      <h2>Materials</h2>
      <h3>Cotton</h3>
      <p>
        Some of the SILFEN bags is made from Cotton ‚Äì a fabric commonly known as
        polluting. At SILFEN, our cotton is either made from eco-friendly or
        organic cotton. Both materials require far less water consumption than
        conventional cotton products. Every nylon product is made from
        eco-friendly material, meaning that the journey from raw material to
        SILFEN bag impacts the environment as little as possible.
      </p>

      <h3>Leather</h3>
      <p>
        All leather goods are made from sustainable high-quality calf leather
        and is a bi product of the food industry, meaning that every part of the
        animal is utilized in various industries. We love colors and new trends,
        but we incorporate consciousness and quality in our design processes to
        retain timelessness in all products. All our components, zippers,
        thread, reinforcement, glue etc., are made from high-quality raw
        materials. We encourage our customers to take good care of their bag,
        prolonging the life of the product. By caring for your bag, you will be
        able to create more experiences with it ‚Äì an important factor in
        creating a more sustainable, mindful business.
      </p>

      <h3>Vegan</h3>
      <p>
        In 2019, we presented our first vegan option in a collection, and we
        have continued to this since then. We make sure that all non-leather
        material ‚Äì e.g. our nylon, lacquer ‚Äì are all 100% vegan, promising that
        these products do not contain any parts from animals.
      </p>

      <h3>rPET</h3>
      <p>
        In 2020 we are expecting to launch a new collection manufactured in
        rPET, recycled polyethylene terephthalate. The material is well known as
        it is made from water bottles across the world ‚Äì bottles that often end
        up discarded in oceans or nature. This recycled material is primarily
        made from plastic waste collected from the oceans, or from recycled
        plastic bottles gathered from all over the world. With this new
        collection, we aim to emphasize the impact of pollution irresponsible
        wasting. We wish to pass this awareness to our customers, and to
        encourage them to help clean our oceans!
      </p>

      <h2>The path to zero impact</h2>
      <p>
        Since day one, we have launched various initiatives to keep our carbon
        footprint to a minimum as well as making conscious decisions concerning
        the social impact on the communities in the countries, in which we
        operate. Explore our sustainable selection of bags made from recycled
        nylon, vegan leather, eco-friendly or organic cotton here.
